I created my personal portfolio website during my internship at CodSoft. This project allowed me to Craft a User-Friendly Website by Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A portfolio website allows me to Showcase My Skills & Experience Curating my projects and highlighting key skills helped me demonstrate my capabilities as a web developer.
Building this portfolio gave me valuable hands-on experience and helped me better understand web development principles.
I also attached a video of my portfolio.
